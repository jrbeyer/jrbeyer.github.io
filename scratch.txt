<h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I am a computer engineer interested in embedded computing and controls design. Most recently I was a software engineering intern for General Motors developing a test automation environment for next-generation engine control modules utilizing hardware-in-the-loop, but in previous research and work I have engaged with robotics, controls engineering, low- and high-voltage electrical hardware, and register-transfer level design.</p>
                        <p>I am a current Master of Engineering student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University. I also completed my undergraduate studies at Princeton, graduating Highest Honors with a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, along with Phi Beta Kappa, Tau Beta Pi, and Sigma Xi nominations.</p>
