						<p>My senior thesis, “A Kalman Filter Approach to Automated Mid-Infrared Beam Mapping: Quantum Cascade Laser Far-Field Patterns,” was an opportunity for me to apply my interests in control theory and robotics to a totally new (to me) domain: optics and lasers. The crux of the thesis is a proposal for a Kalman filter-based algorithm for the measurement of the far-field pattern of mid-infrared beams, and the construction and demonstration of a device capable of executing the algorithm. Such measurements are especially important because mid-IR beams, with applications in environmental sensing and long-distance communications, are invisible to the human eye.</p>

						<p>After discussing a number of potential thesis topics with my advisor, Professor Claire Gmachl, I had the idea for what would become my thesis in a true “shower thought” -- assuming a Gaussian beam profile (a reasonable approximation for most beams), one could construct an increasingly accurate estimate of the position and shape of the beam in cross-sections along the direction of propagation by fitting randomly-sampled measurements to a Gaussian distribution. That new Gaussian would be the distribution from which new candidate measurement locations would be sampled, resulting in a converging estimate of the beam profile. This is the same principle that underlies the Kalman filter, a tool for state estimation in robotics where Gaussian uncertainty exists in measurement and position.</p>

						<p>One aspect of my thesis I am particularly proud of are the data visualizations I created. Working with data that I collected gave me the creativity to display them however I saw fit, and some of the results are shown here. These graphs show the intensity of a single profile of the laser (with intensity plotted on the z axis), as well as the intensities of multiple profiles in 3D space. In the context of the paper, my data visualizations play a strong role in justifying the functionality of the system.</p>
						<p>The paper was the recipient of the Princeton Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's Bradley Dickinson Award for System Design, “awarded for outstanding accomplishments in the design and implementation of complex electronic systems.” A version of the paper is currently being prepared for submission to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement.</p>
